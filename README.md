# Gold-Price-Predictor

## Overview
This project is a gold price prediction model built using data science techniques. The model uses historical data to predict future gold prices, which can be useful for investors, analysts, or anyone interested in understanding gold price trends.

## Features
- Data Collection: Source data is collected from Gold Price Data [Kaggle].
- Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model training, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature Engineering: Important features are extracted and selected based on their correlation with gold prices.
- Model Building: Various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks are implemented.
- Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to determine the best-performing model.
- Prediction: The final model is used to predict future gold prices based on the input features.
- Visualization: Data visualization techniques are used to display historical data, feature importance, and prediction results.
